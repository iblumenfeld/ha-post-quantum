# ha-post-quantum
This is a repo for my work in the Fall 2016 INSuRE class at UMBC.  

To use this you need to install:

* [Z3 - An SMT solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
* [Cryptol - A DSL for cryptography](https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol)
* [SAW - The software analysis workbench](https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script)
* [clang - The LLVM compiler](http://clang.llvm.org)
* [abc - An equivalence checker and synthesistool](https://bitbucket.org/alanmi/abc)

Each of these may come with its own dependencies which are described in the associated README documents on their project page (e.g. you will definitely need some version of a Haskell compiler.)
